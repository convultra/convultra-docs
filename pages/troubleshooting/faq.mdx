# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Convultra?

Convultra is a conversion tracking platform that captures and forwards conversions to ad platforms with 95-98 percent accuracy, compared to 60-70 percent for client-side pixels.

### How is Convultra different from Google Tag Manager?

| Feature | GTM | Convultra |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Client-side | ✅ | ✅ (SDK) |
| Server-side | ✅ (complex setup) | ✅ (built-in) |
| Ad blocker bypass | ❌ | ✅ |
| ITP/cookie handling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Deduplication | Manual | Automatic |
| Platform forwarding | Manual | Automatic |

### Does Convultra work with ad blockers?

Yes. Convultra's server-side approach bypasses most ad blockers because:
- Requests go to your endpoint, not ad servers
- No third-party scripts to block
- Server-to-server forwarding

---

## Installation

### Can I use Convultra with my existing pixels?

Yes. Convultra works alongside existing pixels:
- Keep your gtag.js, Facebook Pixel, etc.
- Convultra provides redundant server-side tracking
- Deduplication prevents double-counting

### Does the SDK slow down my site?

The SDK is:
- ~15KB gzipped
- Loaded asynchronously
- Non-blocking
- Minimal CPU usage

Impact on Core Web Vitals is negligible.

### What frameworks are supported?

Convultra works with any JavaScript framework:
- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Any HTML page

## Privacy & Compliance

### Is Convultra GDPR compliant?

Yes. Convultra:
- Does not require cookies for basic analytics
- Supports consent management
- Provides data deletion APIs
- Operates under strict data processing agreements

### Do I need a cookie consent banner?

For **analytics only**: No. Convultra's analytics are cookie-free and privacy-respecting.

For **conversion tracking with Enhanced Conversions**: Consult your legal team, as you're processing PII (even if hashed).

### Does Convultra store PII?

Convultra:
- Hashes all user data (email, phone, etc.) immediately
- Never stores raw PII
- Stores only hashed identifiers for matching
- Provides data retention controls

### Does Convultra track users across sites?

No. Each project is isolated. Cross-domain tracking only works between domains you explicitly configure for the same project.

---

## Platform Integrations

### Which ad platforms are supported?

Currently supported:
- Google Ads
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
- Microsoft Ads
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X

More coming soon.

### Do I need separate Convultra accounts per platform?

No. One Convultra project can forward to all platforms simultaneously.

### How long does platform authorization last?

OAuth tokens typically last:
- Google: 6 months (auto-refresh)
- Meta: 60 days
- Microsoft: 90 days

Convultra auto-refreshes when possible.

## Data & Analytics

### How real-time is the data?

| Data Type | Delay |
|-----------|-------|
| Events | 2-5 seconds |
| Aggregations | ~30 seconds |
| Platform forwarding | under 5 minutes |

### How long is data retained?

Default retention:
- Events: 2 years
- Sessions: 90 days
- Click IDs: 90 days

Configurable per project.

### Can I export my data?

Yes:
- Dashboard: CSV export
- API: JSON/CSV endpoints
- Webhooks: Real-time export

---

## Technical

### What happens if Convultra is down?

The SDK queues events locally and retries when the endpoint is available. No data is lost during brief outages.

### Can I self-host Convultra?

The SDK can point to any endpoint. For full self-hosting of the backend, contact us for enterprise licensing.

### What's the API rate limit?

- SDK: No limit (batched automatically)
- Server API: 1000 requests/minute per project
- Webhooks: Outbound only, no limit

### Does Convultra work on mobile apps?

The JavaScript SDK is for web. For mobile:
- Use the Server API directly
- Or integrate with your analytics SDK

---

## Billing

### How are events counted?

Events counted toward your plan:
- Page views
- Custom events
- Conversions

Not counted:
- API queries
- Dashboard views
- Bot traffic (filtered)

### What happens if I exceed my limit?

- You'll receive warnings at 80% and 100%
- Tracking continues for 48 hours
- After 48 hours, new events are dropped
- Historical data is never deleted

### Can I upgrade/downgrade anytime?

Yes. Plan changes take effect immediately:
- Upgrades: Prorated for remaining period
- Downgrades: Effective next billing cycle

---

## Common Scenarios

### Can I track logged-in users across devices?

Yes, with `identify()`:

```javascript
Convultra.identify('user_12345', {
  email: 'user@example.com'
})
```

### Can I track without JavaScript?

Yes, use the [pixel endpoint](/api-reference/pixel-tracking):

```html
<img src="https://your-endpoint.com/v1/pixel.gif?event_type=purchase&..." />
```

### Can I track server-side only?

Yes, use the [Server API](/api-reference/server-api):

```javascript
await fetch('https://your-endpoint.com/v1/track', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SERVER_KEY' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ event_type: 'purchase', ... })
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why are my conversions not showing in Google Ads?

1. Check click ID (gclid) was captured
2. Check integration is connected
3. Check conversion action mapping
4. Check forwarding logs for errors
5. Wait up to 6 hours (Google delay)

See [Common Issues](/troubleshooting/common-issues)

### Why is my match rate low?

1. Add Enhanced Conversions user data
2. Verify click IDs are being captured
3. Check data formatting
4. See [Enhanced Conversions](/sdk/enhanced-conversions)

### Why do I see duplicate events?

1. Check for page reloads on thank you page
2. Check SDK isn't included twice
3. Check orderId is unique
4. See [Deduplication](/advanced/deduplication)
