## Platform Forwarding

### Forwarding Status

Each conversion shows status per connected platform:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ **Sent** | Successfully delivered |
| ⏳ **Pending** | In queue |
| 🔄 **Retrying** | Failed, retrying |
| ❌ **Failed** | Permanent failure |
| ⚪ **N/A** | Not applicable |

### Why "N/A"?

A conversion shows N/A for a platform when:
- No click ID for that platform (user didn't come from that ad)
- Platform not connected
- Event type not mapped

### Viewing Logs

**Conversions → [Click conversion] → View Forwarding Logs**

Detailed logs show:
- Timestamp
- Request sent
- Response received
- Error details (if any)

## Conversion Recovery

Convultra identifies "recovered" conversions that would have been lost:

### What Gets Recovered?

| Scenario | Native Tracking | Convultra |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Ad blocker | ❌ Lost | ✅ Captured |
| ITP/Cookie limits | ❌ Lost | ✅ Captured |
| Privacy browsers | ❌ Lost | ✅ Captured |
| Cross-device | ❌ Lost | ✅ Captured (with Enhanced) |

### Recovery Metrics

**Conversions → Recovery**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Recovered Conversions | Conversions that had no native pixel fire |
| Recovery Rate | % of total conversions that were recovered |
| Recovered Value | Revenue from recovered conversions |

<Callout>
  On average, Convultra recovers 30-40% more conversions than client-side pixels alone.
</Callout>

---

## Deduplication

Convultra prevents double-counting:

### Deduplication Methods

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Order ID | Same orderId within 24h = duplicate |
| Event ID | Same eventId within 5min = duplicate |
| Click ID | Same click ID + value within 1h = duplicate |
| Fingerprint | Same fingerprint + value within 5min = duplicate |

### Viewing Duplicates

Duplicate events are logged but not counted:

**Conversions → View Duplicates**
