# LinkedIn Ads Integration

Send conversions to LinkedIn via the Conversions API for B2B tracking.

## Prerequisites

- LinkedIn Campaign Manager account
- Admin access to your LinkedIn Page
- Insight Tag installed (optional but recommended)

---

## Setup

<Steps>
### Connect Your Account

1. Go to **Dashboard → Integrations**
2. Click **Connect LinkedIn Ads**
3. Sign in with your LinkedIn account
4. Authorize Convultra access

### Select Ad Account

Choose which LinkedIn ad account should receive conversions.

### Configure Conversion Events

Map Convultra events to LinkedIn conversion types:

| Convultra Event | LinkedIn Conversion |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `lead` | Lead |
| `signup` | Sign Up |
| `purchase` | Purchase |
| Custom events | Custom conversions |
</Steps>

---

## Li_fat_id Attribution

LinkedIn uses `li_fat_id` for first-party click attribution:

```
User clicks LinkedIn ad → https://yoursite.com/?li_fat_id=abc123...
         ↓
Convultra captures li_fat_id → Stores for 90 days
         ↓
User converts → li_fat_id included in conversion
         ↓
LinkedIn matches to original ad click
```

---

## Enhanced Matching

For B2B, email is the primary matching identifier:

```javascript copy
Convultra.trackConversion('lead',
  {
    leadId: 'LEAD-12345',
    value: 500, // Lead value
    formName: 'Demo Request'
  },
  {
    email: 'prospect@company.com',  // Work email preferred
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Doe'
  }
)
```

<Callout>
  LinkedIn matching works best with work email addresses since users are signed in with their professional profiles.
</Callout>

## B2B Best Practices

### Track High-Value Actions

```javascript
// Demo request (high intent)
Convultra.trackLead({
  leadId: 'DEMO-12345',
  value: 1000,
  formName: 'Book Demo'
})

// Content download (lead nurturing)
Convultra.trackDownload({
  downloadId: 'DL-12345',
  fileName: 'B2B Buyers Guide',
  category: 'lead_magnet'
})

// Trial signup (conversion)
Convultra.trackSignup({
  userId: 'trial_12345',
  plan: 'enterprise_trial'
})
```

### Use Lead Value

Assign monetary values to different lead types:

| Lead Type | Suggested Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| Newsletter signup | $10 |
| Content download | $50 |
| Webinar registration | $100 |
| Demo request | $500 |
| Trial signup | $1,000 |

## Monitoring

### LinkedIn Campaign Manager

1. Go to **Campaign Manager**
2. Navigate to **Analyze** → **Conversion tracking**
3. View conversion data

### Convultra Logs

**Dashboard → Integrations → LinkedIn Ads → View Logs**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Match Rate

B2B matching can be lower than B2C because:
- Users may use personal email on your site
- Work email in LinkedIn differs from site signup

**Solutions**:
1. Ask for work email in forms
2. Use company domain matching
3. Include li_fat_id in all landing pages
